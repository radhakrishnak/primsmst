This is implementation of Prim's minimum cost spanning tree using Fibonacci heap

There are two modes of operation. 
1. User mode 
2. Random mode : a random connected graph will be generated with specified number of vertices & edges

once the program is built with 'make' an executable prim.o will be generated.

its has help options if there are any missing arguments
